        Hello, World! I am a full-stack Rails &amp; Javascript developer
        currently living in <del>Berkeley, CA</del> Davis, CA.

      <section>
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I have been passionate about programming for over half of my life. My first
          website, a custom blog written in PHP, was pushed to the Internet in
          2004. I was 14 years old. Since then I have worked with a myriad of
          programming languages and frameworks. My tools of choice are Rails, and
          recently React.js.
        </p>
        <p>
          AFK, I am a avid rock climber and music lover. I enjoy playing guitar,
          making art, and excellent conversation. On the weekends you are most likely to
          to find me hanging from a cliff, beer in hand, somewhere near Lake Tahoe.
        </p>
        <p>
          I focus on writing performant, responsive, and well tested web applications.
          If you would like to get in contact, or just say hello, you can email
          me at: <a
            href="mailto:bitwiselove@gmail.com">bitwiselove@gmail.com</a>, or
          find me on Twitter:

          <p>I have been quite fortunate to work alongside Brandon. It has been an absolute pleasure bouncing ideas back and forth with a highly skilled and talented frontend developer. Not only does Brandon take into consideration what we want as a company, but also provides his own valuable input tapped directly from his breadth of experience. In many instances, and what I consider to be very rare as an employee asset, Brandon constantly researches and improves upon your initial idea to create something that is more visually appealing and technically-functional then we would have started with.</p>

          <h3>Kodansha Comics Reader <small>Web Development &amp; Software Engineering</small></h3>
          <p>
            I developed an interactive comic book reader for Kodansha Comics.
            The reader was built with React.js, using Wordpress as a backend for
            content management. It features smart asynchronous image preloading, multiple layout views,
            keyboard navigation, and Google Analytics event integration.

          <h3>City Bicycle Company <small>Design &amp; Development</small></h3>
          <p>
            City Bicycle Company came to me seeking a complete responsive
            overhaul of their current ecommerce and marketing website. I created
            wireframes with Adobe Illustrator and mocked compositions with
            Adobe Photoshop. Then implemented that design using a modern
            workflow consisting of Gulp, Javascript, SCSS, and Liquid. The result is a
            sleek and responsive ecommerce shop created with best-practices in mind.

          <h3>CMG Landscape Architecture <small>Wordpress Development</small></h3>
          <p>
            I was contracted to help develop features for CMG's Wordpress
            website. I developed a system that allowed CMG to easily feature
            their projects, awards, and press. I halved their page load by
            optimizing network requests and slow Wordpress SQL queries. I also updated
            the site to be more mobile-friendly.

          <p>
            Slaplike is a personal project that I have been working on. It is a Rails application
            that uses Last.fm and YouTube APIs to discover new music. It is
            currently being rewritten with Node.js and Express on the backend
            with React.js and Redux managing the frontend.
